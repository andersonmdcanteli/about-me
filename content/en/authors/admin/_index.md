I have a Bachelor in Food Engineering from the State University of Maringá (2011), Master (2013) and Doctor (2018) in Food Engineering from the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR). I have experience with bakery product production, sensory analysis, dairy quality control, aroma recovery, wastewater treatment and data analysis. My main area of expertise is the adsorption/desorption process (batch and fixed bed) and data analysis. I have experience in the area of product and process optimization (DOE), model validation, modeling and adsorption process. I am the main developer of the CAVS - adsorption evaluation software, and I am also the current maintainer. I am interested in the area of multivariate data analysis, using neural networks and multivariate techniques, preferably using Python or R. I have experience in developing software and packages applied to scientific research, using MATLAB and mainly Python. I am currently teaching courses on Validation of Analytical Methods and Optimization of Products and Processes (andersoncanteli.com.br). I also develop dashboards for data analysis using Python.
